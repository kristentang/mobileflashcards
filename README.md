# Mobile Flashbards

This app is the third project in the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to use React Native to implement a mobile app.

Data is stored using AsyncStorage, a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app. It is React Native's version of local storage.

Additionally, [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) was used to bootstrap the project.

## Install and Run Project
